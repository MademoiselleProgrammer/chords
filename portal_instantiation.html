* Choose the *CloudFormation* service from the AWS [services page](https://aws.amazon.com/).
* Mash *Create Stack* to start the CloudFormation wizard.
* Configure:
  1. *Select Template* page:
    *  Give the stack a name. 
    * Paste the following link into "Specify an S3 template URL": https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/chords-template/chords.template
  2. *Specify Parameters* page: 
    * Select an EC2 KeyPair for *KeyName*. This will allow you to ssh into the instance, if ever needed.
  3. *Options* page:
    * Skip.
  4. *Review* page: 
    * Verify that everything looks good.
    * Mash the *Create* button. 

After the creation has started, you will be taken 
to the stack summary page. Select the stack, and go to the *Events* tab to watch the progress 
of the stack creation. It usually takes about 4 minutes to complete, but it can take much longer (even 30 minutes), 
depending upon AWS loads.

Once the stack is running, the *Outputs* tab will provide a URL for the new CHORDS Portal. Click on the 
link to access the Portal.

If the provisioning fails, the instance will be stopped, and you won't know why. You can redo the process, 
and disable the rollback, so that the instance is left running. To do this, when on the *Options* page, 
open the Advanced section, and change "Rollback on Failure" to *No*. This will
keep the instance running when the provisioning fails, so that you can ssh in and diagnose the problem.
