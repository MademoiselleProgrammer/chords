# The CHORDS Portal

* Is a web server that accepts real-time data from distributed instruments, and serves 
the measurements to anyone on the Internet. The data are pushed to and pulled from the Portal using 
simple HTTP requests.
* Is a monitoring tool which allows you to monitor and insure that your remote instruments are
operating correctly.
* Is a rolling archive from which scientists and analysts can easily fetch the data in
real-time, delivered directly to browsers, programs and mobile apps via standard protocols.
* Is an entry point to sophisticated real-time web services that can convert your data streams to
standardized formats such as OGC, and provide discovery, aggregation and other web-enabled functions. 

# Owning a Portal

The Portal is targeted at users who do not have IT staffs and large IT budgets. It is an appliance which you 
run on amazon Web Services:

* Ownership: You have complete control of the portal. You create it and manage it yourself, without
having to rely on external tech support.
* It's Cheap: The portal, for a modest network of instruments (say 10), will cost about $0.50 a day to operate
on Amazon.
* Setting It Up: The one requirement is a credit card, to create an Amazon Web Services account. From
your account, you will follow a short recipe to create a new Portal (server) running on Amazon. 
You then go to your Portal web page and configure it for your project.

# Caveats

* Currently the Portal only processes teme-series measurements. Plans are under way to add 
additional data types, such as soundings, ray-oriented observations, and images.
